# Code Quality Rules

1. Test Coverage:
   - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

2. Lint Rules:
   - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval

3. Styling Guidelines:
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of inline style objects for new markup
   - VSCode CSS variables must be added to webview-ui/src/index.css before using them in Tailwind classes
   - Example: `<div className="text-md text-vscode-descriptionForeground mb-2" />` instead of style objects

4. Git Commit Messages:
   - Use the following format for commit messages:
     - `feat: <description>` for new features
     - `fix: <description>` for bug fixes
     - `chore: <description>` for maintenance tasks
   - Example: `feat: add new setting to persist state`
   - commit every time you add a new feature or fix a bug

# Adding a New Setting

To add a new setting that persists its state, follow the steps in cline_docs/settings.md
